title: Avoid partial classes
severity: 2
---
Partial classes pose the threat of being misused and thereby hide code smells. An example missusage would be separating parts of classes that deal with different tasks. That would hide the harm of the single responsibility principle.

**Exception:** Partial classes can be used to add further functionality to generated classes.
