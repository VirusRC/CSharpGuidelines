title: Don't hard-code strings that change based on the deployment
severity: 2

Examples include connection strings, server addresses, etc. Use `Resources`, the `ConnectionStrings` property of the `ConfigurationManager` class, or the `Settings` class generated by Visual Studio. Maintain the actual values into the `app.config` or `web.config` (and most definitely not in a custom configuration store).
