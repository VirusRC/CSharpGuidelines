title: Place members in a well-defined order
severity: 1
---
Maintaining a common order allows other team members to find their way in your code more easily. In general, a source file should be readable from top to bottom, as if reading a book, to prevent readers from having to browse up and down through the code file.

1. Private fields and constants
2. Public constants
3. Public static read-only fields
4. Factory methods
5. Constructors and the finalizer
6. Events 
7. Public properties

Declare local functions at the bottom of their containing method bodies (after all executable code). Public methods should be stated above private methods.
