title: Methods should not exceed a reasonable number of individual statements
severity: 3
---
A method that requires too many individual statements is simply doing too much or has too many responsibilities. It also requires the human mind to analyze the exact statements to understand what the code is doing. Break it down into multiple small and focused methods with self-explaining names, but make sure the high-level algorithm is still clear.

**Note** Stating a concrete number instead of "reasonable number" would be wrong in too many cases. The number of individual statements that are still understandable depends on a wide variaty of other factors than just the amount of statements itself.
